## We're Back!

### Our first event last year was such an incredible success that we couldn't resist doing it again!

**Our mission remains the same: raising money for our dear friend and colleague Dr Sophie Williams. But this time we will share a portion with Treborth Botanic Garden as a thank you for their deep support, without which there wouldn’t be a festival. It is widely known that Sophie has felt and still feels so passionately about Treborth Botanic Garden.**

Draig Beats will be held on **Saturday the 8th of June 2019** from **10am until 9pm** in Treborth Botanic Garden. It’s a family friendly, fundraising event with plenty of live music, workshops, vegan food & drink and lots of activities to keep the kids busy!

We are trying to keep ticket prices to a minimum but still aim to raise as much money as possible to help support Sophie to live at home in North Wales, following 4 years of intensive care, rehabilitation and placements in multiple care homes.

All profits from the food and bars and ticket sales will be going directly to the *Sophie Williams Trust* with a small proportion to the *Friends of Treborth Botanic Garden*. Join us for a great day out and help us raise as much money as possible!

We have a great lineup of music and entertainment to announce over the coming weeks, keep checking back to the page and help spread the event amongst your friends.
