Baka Beyond

<td>
We are so thrilled that Baka Beyond are this year's headline act. Originally inspired by the music of the Baka Forest People, Pygmies whose music and dance have been celebrated since the time of the Pharaohs, Baka Beyond use the Baka rhythms to fuse music from the band-members’ Celtic and African roots. The resultant music is highly infectious and crosses boundaries of genre, age and ethnicity.

The spirit of the 'swing' era of the 1940s in North Wales!  The acoustic trio brings alive the spirit of Django Reinhardt and Stephane Grappelli- the classy sound of acoustic jazz, from foot-tapping classics of the swing era to more modern tunes given the Manouche treatment. Dance if you want; or just get transported to the evocative era of Art Deco.

Eve Goodman

Eve Goodman writes songs from the heart; here is a young woman who transmutes the personal into the universal. After her degree in Literature, Eve left the city to live in a cabin on a Cornish farm, where she wrote and recorded her first EP, Low Sun. In her current writing, Eve explores the territory of grief and rising up from the wasteland of loss after losing her father. Against the pain, Eve offers the quiet harmony of a voice who is finding joy again. If you sit, listen and wait, this beautifully crafted new folk light, will unveil earth, soul and a deep connection to what it is to be human in these troubled, inspiring times.
